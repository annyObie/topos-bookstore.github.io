"Just as the Arab Spring presaged the emergence of Occupy in the United States, the gilets jaunes may foretell the emergence of a similar movement here."

Join us Thursday, April 11th, at Topos Bookstore Cafe for the launch of the second issue of Commune magazine.

Rona Lorimer, Commune's French correspondent,  will be presenting an updated version of her “Yellow Vest Diaries,” beginning with Act 6, leading us up to the present. From her vantage point on the ground, Rona analyzes the ways in which the movement has developed since January. Rona will reflect both on the French particularities of what’s made the movement so novel, and highlight the general features of this political moment as they have found expression in the Yellow Vest phenomenon. 

Discounted magazines, merchandise, and drinks will be available.
