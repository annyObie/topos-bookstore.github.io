EXTRATRANSMISSION is a poetic critique of nationalism, patriarchy & gender embedded in an explosive & unapologetic trauma narrative. It begins with an exhaustive loud, & unapologetic section on killing bros, the perpetrators of patriarchy before entering a narrative of how traumatic brain injury occurs to bodies in modern warfare. The text labors over how memory constructs our identity, our constant experience and how that can be destroyed in one of many empty military moments. The language pushes beyond conventional lyric and incorporates angry letters, prose pieces, a love poem, & intimate conversation while maintaining both an intense energy and constant movement. In resistance to how patriarchy and U.S. militarism produce the hypergendered subject, the text generates a genderqueer cyborg whose language comes together to form EXTRATRANSMISSION a book that explicates how patriarchy, capitalism, & nationalism form the high rising global city that will tear your heart out.

Andrea Abi-Karam is an arab-american genderqueer punk poet-performer cyborg, writing on the art of killing bros, the intricacies of cyborg bodies, trauma & delayed healing. Their chapbook, THE AFTERMATH (Commune Editions, 2016), attempts to queer Fanonâ€™s vision of how poetry fails to inspire revolution. Simone White selected their second assemblage, Villainy for forthcoming publication with Les Figues. They toured with Sister Spit March 2018 & are hype to live in New York. EXTRATRANSMISSION [Kelsey Street Press, 2019] is their first book.

Neon (NM Esc) is a poet, music writer, and nightlife worker from Brooklyn via post-Soviet diaspora. They write on collectivity, queer intimacies under the surveillance state, smashing borders of all kinds, anxious gq cyborg embodiment, and, occasionally, nÃ¼ metal. Their most recent chapzine, "Last Week's Weather Forecast Made Me Nervous," on how the crisis manifests in the public affect and the private body, was released on Ghost City Press's 2017 summer microchap series. They are currently working on a collection of gay noir.

Kamelya Omayma Youssef is a writer from Dearborn, Michigan. She tends to blur the borders between forms and she hopes that one day borders are obliterated entirely. Her poems and lyric essays have been published in Agape, Mizna, The Michigan Quarterly Review, the captions on her instagram posts, and a forthcoming anthology of arab american literary nonfiction. She is currently pursuing her MFA in poetry at NYU.
