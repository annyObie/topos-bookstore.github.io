# We Buy and Trade Books

We buy and trade used books for $$ or store credit!

We do *not* take:

* damaged books (water damage, cracked spines)
* books with heavy underlining, highlighting, or marginalia
* advanced reader's copies or uncorrected proofs
* ex-library books
* textbooks, test-prep, outdated how-to manuals (i.e. Dummies Guides, computer manuals, etc.) or outdated academic books
* travel guides
* hardcover best-sellers (i.e. Dan Brown, James Patterson, Nora Roberts etc.).

We also do *not* take donations, meaning we will not take any old book. But we will most certainly buy or give you store credit for the books we can take!

If you have more than one box of books, please email [toposbookstore@gmail.com](mailto:toposbookstore@gmail.com) or [call {{ site.data.contact_info.telephone }}](tel:{{ site.data.contact_info.telephone }}) to find out when a book buyer is in.

We make house visits for large collections as well!
